    "force_electrostatics": "The force exerted by stationary electric charges on each other, governed by Coulomb's law.",
    "resistance": "The opposition to the flow of electric current, measured in ohms.",
    "current": "The flow of electric charge per unit of time, typically measured in amperes (A).",
    "voltage": "The electrical potential difference between two points, measured in volts (V), which determines the flow of current in a circuit.",
    "power": "The rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit, measured in watts (W).",
    "ohms_law": "A fundamental principle stating that the current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance between them.",
