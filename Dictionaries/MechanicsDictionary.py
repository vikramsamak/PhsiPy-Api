    "velocity": "Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. It is a vector quantity, having both magnitude and direction.",
    "displacement": "Displacement is the change in position of an object. It is a vector quantity, representing the shortest distance between the initial and final points.",
    "acceleration": "Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time. It is a vector quantity.",
    "uniform_accelerated_motion": "Uniform accelerated motion describes the motion of an object with constant acceleration. The equations of motion relate displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.",
    "force": "Force is an influence that can change the motion of an object. It is a vector quantity, described by Newton's second law (F=ma).",
