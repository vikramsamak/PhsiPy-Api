    "force": "In physics, force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. It can cause an object to accelerate, decelerate, or change direction.",
    "momentum": "In physics, momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity. It represents the quantity of motion possessed by the object and is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.",
    "recoil_velocity": "In physics, recoil velocity refers to the velocity acquired by an object as a result of the conservation of momentum when it interacts with another object. This often occurs when a firearm is discharged, and the backward motion of the gun (recoil) is balanced by the forward motion of the bullet.",
