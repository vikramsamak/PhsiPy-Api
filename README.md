## Overview

**PhsiPy-Api** is a REST API designed to simplify complex scientific calculations. Built using Python and FastAPI, this API provides a wide range of physics-based calculations with high precision and efficiency. The API can be easily integrated into applications that require backend physics computations.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Calculations**: Supports a variety of physics calculations, including mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and more.
- **Fast and Scalable**: Built on FastAPI, ensuring high performance and scalability.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple RESTful endpoints designed for quick integration into any application.
- **Deployed on Vercel**: Accessible globally with reliable hosting.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under MIT, making it free to use and contribute.
